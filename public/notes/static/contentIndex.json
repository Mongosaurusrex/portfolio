It’s rarely about the latest or flashiest gear; more often, it’s the things that have quietly stood the test of time. The small-but-mighty tools and habits that keep the wheels turning day after day — that’s the stuff I find most interesting.\nAs someone who works at the intersection of data engineering, data science, and human rights — while also being a dad of two — I’ve come to rely on a handful of tools that just work. These aren’t necessarily the most popular or expensive options, but they’ve earned their place by helping me stay efficient, focused, and (mostly) sane. Here are the essentials I can’t live without — and a few honorable mentions that deserve a shout-out.\n\n🧠 Tools I Can’t Live Without\n🖥️ My Machine (MacBook Pro)\nI’ve been a Linux user for many years and honestly never would’ve bought a Mac unless my employer paid for it. But after years of constant tinkering, fixing, and configuring things under Linux, switching to a Mac — where ✨ everything just works ✨ — has been worth every second. It lets me focus on what I actually want to do: write code, build things, and not debug my environment.\n⌨️ My Keyboard (Kinesis Advantage2)\nThis thing looks like it belongs on a spaceship — and honestly, it kind of does. The Kinesis Advantage2 is an ergonomic, split-layout keyboard that took me a couple of weeks to get used to, but now I can’t imagine working without it. It’s helped reduce wrist strain during long coding sessions, and the thumb clusters are a game-changer for common shortcuts. Expensive? Yes. Overkill? Maybe. But for me, it’s an investment in longevity and focus — and one of the best I’ve made.\n🧙‍♂️ My Editor (Neovim)\nI’ve tried a lot of editors, but Neovim is the one I keep coming back to. It’s fast, minimal, and lets me mold my environment exactly the way I want. Sure, the initial setup feels like a side project of its own, but once it clicks, it’s incredibly productive. Whether I’m building data pipelines, debugging something messy, or just writing Markdown — being inside Neovim feels like home. It’s not for everyone, but for me, the control, speed, and focus it gives is unmatched.\n🐍 My Language (Python)\nIt might not be the fastest or the trendiest, but Python is the tool I reach for again and again. It’s the duct tape of data — flexible, readable, and supported everywhere. Whether I’m cleaning messy CSVs, writing ETL jobs, building machine learning models, or scripting a quick fix, Python gets it done without fuss. The ecosystem is massive, the libraries are mature, and the balance between readability and power fits perfectly with how I think. It’s not just a language for me — it’s the foundation of my entire workflow.\n✨ Honorable Mentions\nThese are tools I don’t absolutely need every single day — but when I do use them, they make life noticeably better.\n📊 dbt\nIt took a while for me to “get” dbt, but once I did, it became a staple for transforming data cleanly and transparently. It’s like version control for SQL, and when paired with good documentation, it makes working with data models a joy — or at least less of a pain.\n📋 Notion\nI don’t manage my life in it, but it’s where I draft blog posts, capture ideas, and plan projects. It’s the digital equivalent of a whiteboard — clean, structured, and there when I need it.\n🧪 Jupyter Notebooks\nSometimes you just want to poke at data, test a theory, or sketch out a model. Notebooks are great for that. I don’t build anything long-term in them, but for exploratory work, they’re still hard to beat.\n📐 Texas Instruments TI-82 Stats\nThis one’s a bit of a wildcard, but it deserves a mention. The TI-82 Stats calculator was my first real exposure to the idea that math could be interactive — that I could test things, explore, and not just follow steps. I even started coding on it back in high school, making little games and cheats to get through math classes. Later, it helped me survive those chaotic calculus sessions in university. It may not be in my daily toolkit anymore, but in a way, it’s where all of this started.\n\nThat’s my current lineup — a mix of tools that help me stay productive, stay sane, and occasionally stay nostalgic. I’m always curious about what others rely on, so if you’ve got a must-have tool, a weird keyboard, or a setup hack you swear by, I’d love to hear about it. Drop a comment or hit reply — I’m here for the gear talk.\nThanks for reading,\n– N"},"Stupid-data-science/ufo":{"slug":"Stupid-data-science/ufo","filePath":"Stupid data science/ufo.md","title":"Here Are the Most UFO-Friendly States in the U.S.","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nWhere in America are you most likely to spot something strange in the sky — and actually report it?\n\nEach year, thousands of Americans file reports of unidentified flying objects. But not all states are created equal when it comes to scanning the skies. Some places seem to be absolute UFO magnets — and it’s not always where you’d expect.\nSo we asked ourselves:\nWhat makes a state “UFO-friendly”?\nWe landed on two ingredients:\n\n🛸 How often people report UFO sightings (scaled per million residents)\n🌾 How rural the state is, which we used as a rough stand-in for things like open skies, less light pollution, and maybe — just maybe — a stronger belief in the unexplained.\n\nTogether, these make up our UFO Visibility Index — a totally unscientific but super fun score to rank every U.S. state’s UFO-spotting potential.\nLet’s dig in.\n\n👀 UFO Sightings per Million People\n\nThis map shows how many UFO sightings each state has reported per million residents — giving small but active states like Vermont a fair shot against behemoths like California.\n🧠 Top Performers\n\nVermont, Montana, and Washington top the list with the highest sightings-per-million.\nThe Pacific Northwest and Northeast seem especially active — is it all the forests? The coffee? Or just more sky-gazing?\n\nWhatever it is, these folks are paying attention.\n\n🌾 Rural Percentage of Population\n\nWhy does rurality matter? Well, it could mean clearer skies, fewer city lights, and maybe even a greater willingness to believe or report something strange up there.\nThis map shows what percent of each state’s population lives in rural areas.\n🏞️ Leaders in Rural Life\n\nVermont, Maine, and West Virginia take the rural crown.\nThe most urbanized? California, Nevada, and New Jersey — all clocking in under 10% rural population.\n\nNot saying rural folks believe more in aliens, but… they do have better stargazing conditions. 👀\n\n🚀 The UFO Visibility Index\n\nNow comes the fun part.\nWe combined the two normalized metrics — sightings-per-million and rural population percentage — into a single UFO Visibility Index using Min-Max scaling.\nSo what does this index show?\n\nIt highlights states where people are reporting sightings and live in areas where sky visibility is likely better.\nHigher index = better “UFO spotting conditions” (in theory, of course 😎).\n\n🥇 Top UFO-Friendly States:\n\nMaine, Alaska, and Montana dominate the rankings.\nThese states strike a curious balance: lots of rural land and people eager to report what’s flying through it.\n\n\n🧪 Method Notes\nThis was all done in a Python notebook — no fancy modeling, just some data wrangling, normalization, and choropleth mapping for fun.\nIf you’re curious, the correlation between rural population percentage and sightings-per-million sits at around 0.25. Not huge, but definitely not nothing.\nCheck out the full notebook here to explore the code and data sources.\n\n👋 Final Thoughts\nSo there you have it — if you’re hoping to catch something weird in the sky, Vermont, Maine, Alaska, and Montana might be your best bets. Whether it’s clearer skies, fewer city lights, or just a greater sense of curiosity, some states definitely seem more tuned in to what’s up there.\nWant to poke around the data yourself or see how this was built?\nCheck out the full notebook and code here.\nKeep your eyes on the skies 👽\n\n📚 Sources\n1.
